# Pinegrow + VSCode

This Visual Studio Code plugin enables live editing with Pinegrow Web Editor. Changes done in Pinegrow are synced to VS Code and vice versa.

[Pinegrow](https://pinegrow.com) is a powerful web editor that lets you visually build Bootstrap, Foundation, WordPress and plain HTML websites.

**Pinegrow 2.9 or newer is required.**

## Live editing in concert

All edits are live-synced between VS Code and Pinegrow, without having to save changes first.

Elements selected in Pinegrow are highlighted in VS Code.

## Control Pinegrow from VS Code

* **Select an element** in Pinegrow withÂ Cmd+Alt+P on Mac, Ctrl+Alt+P on Win / Linux

## Edit HTML and CSS files

Live sync works for HTML (or other types that are listed among editable types in Pinegrow's settings) and CSS/SASS/LESS files.

## How to install

In VS Code, go to Code -> Preferences -> Extensions or click on the Extensions icon in the Activity bar.

There, use the search box to search for "Pinegrow Live Sync".
